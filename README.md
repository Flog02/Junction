**This Application was designed for the Art Caffee challenge of JunctionX Tirana 2025**

Following the requirements and also adding some more on our  own these are the technologies used:
-For creating the app we used Ionic paired with Angular.js 
-Three.js for 3D modeling
-We used Firebase for our backend.

We chose to use Angluar due to our familiarity with it and also the scalability it provides. It also is the framework that best pairs with Ionic in our opinion. Ionic was crucial in our development as its mobile first approach was exactly what we needed. Ionic also 
has this neet little feature called 'capacitors'. They are used for turning an application into a compiled mobile application. It made our job much easier on creating the APK of our app. 

During development a number of other technologies were used. Three.js helped us build a 3D visualization of a model we decided to use.

We used Chart.js to provide charts about nutritions of each product in their nutrition dashboard.

Our team used  FireBase as our designated BackEnd. We have found that its security features and amount of shortcuts it allows you are extremely important in a timed challenge  such as this. We have used it before in hackathons and it has turned into a lucky charm.
It could also be that we are 4 front-end developers, and only 2 of us are still in training to become full-stack, so the help firebase provides is exactly our weakness.

Our work flow was foccused on having to main developers seperate the features they were going to use while two others acted a more supporting role. Fixed minor visual bugs, stating missed errors, performing pair programming. As the roles were switched during the hours , most of the components and pieces of the app have had a look from every single developer. We decided this was the main approach as having too many hannds at the same time would clutter the workspace and in some cases , some branches were left a dozen commits behind 
production. The two supporting roles were extremely helpful in keeping the two developer roles focused and not going on goose chases on new bugs found randomly. The rotation kept the team fresh while at the same time leaving empty hands to work on different parts of 
this hackathon, not consisting of the project itself, notably speaking, the video.

A challenge that we found was the mentoring of a member who had no previous experience on angular per say, but was proficient on react. The framework proved easy to understand and with the exception of some very complicated tasks, they made themselves useful throughout the 
competition.

The hardest part of the project proved to be the development of QR code scanning. That took the most amount of grit from the team, as noone had worked on a similar task before.

The app's description stands as: 
1. Iâ€™ve created an ordering page where users can customize foods and drinks, where the orders can be highly specific and customizable.

2. FireStore is used as the database and backend for the app.

3. I integrate QR scanning, allowing users to scan a table code and order directly from their seat.

4. Nutrition Tracker - to make your dietary restrictions easier to follow.

5. I display this data on a dashboard using Chart.js, giving users visual feedback on their consumption.

6. 3D Coffee Visualization

7. I use Three.js to render dynamic 3D coffee models based on order details.

8. I implement a points-based loyalty system to track points, tiers, and redemption history.

9. We created a journey page to show every step the product takes and where it is sourced from, to increase customer trust.

10. We have implemented a game to improve user interaction.

11. There is a recommendations tab that shows up only when you have made orders and is custom tailored to the user's preferences.

12. There is a gift card system to receive discounts, but you can also send gift cards to your friends.

13. There is an order tracking system that takes live updates from staff accounts on the stage of your order.

14. There is a whole new version of the app for staff, where they can manage all orders, previous ones, and many different features.
