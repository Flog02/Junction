**This Application was designed for the Art Caffee challenge of JunctionX Tirana 2025**

Following the requirements and also adding some more on our  own these are the technologies used:
For creating the app we used Ionic paired with Angular.js

-We chose to use Angluar due to our familiarity with it and also the scalability it provides. It also is the framework that best pairs with Ionic in our opinion. Ionic was crucial in our development as its mobile first approach was exactly what we needed. Ionic also 
has this neet little feature called 'capacitors'. They are used for turning an application into a compiled mobile application. It made our job much easier on creating the APK of our app. 

During development a number of other technologies were used. Three.js helped us build a 3D visualization of a model we decided to use.
